I noticed the webp exports from Sketch still seemed larger than I expected, likely because the exports are losseless. Unfortunately, [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) doesn’t support compressing WebP, but I did find [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp) CLI which helped cut the exported file’s size in half.

Command I used for cutting an export size in half:

```
cwebp input-file.webp -o lossy-output.webp -m 6 -af
```
