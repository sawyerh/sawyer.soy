In user research, archetypes are often used to describe a group of users with similar needs, priorities, and general outlooks. Archetypes aren't tied to an identity, and a person can move between archetypes depending on the context.

Archetypes can be helpful when designing services, but they can also be useful when thinking about teams. Each individual brings their unique strengths and perspectives to the group, and when certain archetypes are present together, the collective can result in a high-performing team. Below are some of the archetypes I've enjoyed working with when I've been fortunate to work on such a team.
