> if we just put the time and effort we were spending on estimates into actually completing tasks, we would get a lot more done

> always talking about how we described the work, rather than the actual work itself

> Many developers have been breaking down work and iterating for their entire careers. If your team has been working together for a while, they should be used to cracking chunks of their problem space into manageable tickets. And once that problem has been solved, a few key metrics can track and even predict how quickly that work is finished.

> If you’re worried that your team isn’t reducing its stories well enough, just turn to a concept from the Kanban method of Agile: Cycle Time. Track the time your stories spend between In progress and Done and you can tell how well you’re breaking down tickets. If the average cycle time of a task increases from, say, 36 hours to 7 or 10 days, use that as a catalyst for a conversation about work breakdown in those all important team retrospectives.
