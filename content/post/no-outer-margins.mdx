> The problem with outer margins and paddings like the examples above is that it breaks encapsulation. [...] Essentially, styles like these have an impact on the other components around it. Components with outer margins get their elbows out, NBA Jam style, knocking around adjacent components.

> The impact of these styles often lead to what I call “compensations”, essentially workarounds to undo what we’ve already done.

> Not only do outer margins require compensations, they give the underlying component too many responsibilities. External spacing should never be the responsibility of a component. Components should only ever be concerned with internal spacing.

> The solution to this problem is simple, use parent elements or components for layout and spacing. [...] I find the best solutions heavily use Flex or Grid containers with gap to apply spacing.
