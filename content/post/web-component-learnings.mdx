## `is` is cool but not really

Genuinely think Safari is the new Internet Explorer. I was excited to learn about HTMLâ€™s 'is' attribute. Seems like a great way to progressively enhance HTML with custom elements. Then I discovered Safari wonâ€™t support it.

Would have been nice to do the following but it wouldn't have worked in Safari:

```html
<button is="submit-once-button">Submit</button>
```

## Custom Elements Manifest

It's a thing: https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest

## Storybook support for web components is a rough around the edges

- Have to call `customElements.define` in the `preview.js` file for each component
- `@storybook/web-components` is a poorly documented.
- Kinda supports the custom elements manifest via `setCustomElementsManifest` but it but seems to only work when `customElements.define` is called in the component's source file?

## Linting

There's a plugin for Web Components that is handy for catching things [like `is` not being recommended](https://github.com/43081j/eslint-plugin-wc/blob/master/docs/rules/no-customized-built-in-elements.md): https://github.com/43081j/eslint-plugin-wc

## Making it easy to register the element

A few approaches I've seen so far:

A static method:

```js
class SummaryBox extends HTMLElement {
  static register() {
    customElements.define("summary-box", SummaryBox);
  }
  // ...
}

SummaryBox.register();
```

A static property:

ðŸš© `tagName` is part of the [DOM standard though](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/tagName)! This isn't a good approach because the element could be defined with a different tag name.

```js
class SummaryBox extends HTMLElement {
  static tagName = "summary-box";
  // ...
}

customElements.define(SummaryBox.tagName, SummaryBox);
```
