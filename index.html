            href="https://www.navapbc.com">Nava</a>,
          building government services that are simple, effective, and accessible to all. I'm interested in
          researching, prototyping, designing, and building practical, purpose-driven digital services. </p>

        <p>With a range of creative, technical, and product skills, I'm capable of working seamlessly across functions
          to collaborate, plan, execute, and deliver. Ambiguous, unbounded problems excite me. I enjoy exploring
          deeply, applying systems-level thinking to complex problems, and arriving at elegant, comprehensive, and
          inclusive solutions. </p>

        <!-- <p>I believe in consistently giving timely and thorough feedback and guidance, whether on design comps or pull
          requests, pushing a team's work forward by advocating for best practices, and identifying inconsistencies or
          areas to strengthen.</p> -->
